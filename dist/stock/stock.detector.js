/**
 * The single rule that guards LINE from spam:
 *
 *     previous.available === false && current === AVAILABLE   -> notify
 *
 * Everything else is silent. Notably:
 *   - first observation (empty DB / new variant / new store) never notifies,
 *   - UNKNOWN never notifies and never overwrites the last known answer,
 *     so an Apple outage cannot manufacture a false "back in stock" edge,
 *   - AVAILABLE -> AVAILABLE on every 30s tick stays silent,
 *   - AVAILABLE -> UNAVAILABLE is recorded but not pushed.
